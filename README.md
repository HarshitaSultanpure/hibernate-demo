Hibernate Practice Project
This repository contains my Hibernate practice project where I explored and implemented various Hibernate features and concepts using Java.
The project covers core Hibernate functionalities, multiple mapping techniques, and different fetching strategies, making it a complete hands-on reference for Hibernate beginners and practitioners.

📌 Features Implemented
    * Adding Dependencies – Maven dependencies for Hibernate and MySQL.
    * Hibernate Configuration (hibernate.cfg.xml) – Database connection settings and mapping configurations.
    * Annotations – Implemented Hibernate mappings using JPA annotations.
    * Saving Images in Database – Storing binary data (BLOB) in a table.
    * Fetching Objects – Retrieving data using Session and queries.
    * Embedding Objects – Using @Embedded and @Embeddable annotations.
    * One-to-One Mapping – Bi-directional and uni-directional mappings.
    * One-to-Many Mapping – Mapping collections with cascading operations.
    * Many-to-Many Mapping – Associating multiple entities using join tables.
    * Fetch Techniques – Lazy and Eager fetching strategies.
    * Hibernate Object States – Transient, Persistent, and Detached states.

  🛠️ Tech Stack
    * Java – Core language
    * Hibernate ORM – For object-relational mapping
    * MySQL – Database
    * Maven – Dependency management
    * JPA Annotations – For mapping entities
